# Re-Conceptualizing Information System Usage as Usage by (Increasingly Automated) Work Systems

Re-conceptualizing IS usage involves recognizing the growing role of autonomous IT systems. ISUT introduces three axioms and 12 assumptions for sociotechnical and automated work systems. It critiques existing IS theories as inadequate for modern automated practices. An agent responsibility framework aligns IS roles with work facets, demonstrating applicability through four examples. ISUT seeks an integrated, holistic view of IS usage vital in IT-infused environments, critiquing IS discipline's inconsistent definitions. The theory shifts focus from human-computer interaction to IS roles in operational work systems, addressing IS usage complexities.
IS definitions vary (e.g., Alter cites 20; Boell & Cecez-Kecmanovic: 34 in 4 categories), leading to unclear treatment of info as part of IS. Similarly, definitions of system/IS usage are inconsistent. Burton-Jones & Straub note no agreed definition for system usage or its study context content, defining it as involving a user, system, and task. This views systems as hardware/software, not sociotechnical entities. MISQ later used IS use, stating it involves an actor using a system, unclear if exclusively IT. The proposed ISUT sees IS as sociotechnical or fully automated, revising the artifact view. It critiques IS literature's narrow usage scope amid automation and AI. It argues traditional IT adoption and usage queries are now less compelling, as IT's pervasiveness (smartphones, e-commerce) shifts focus to how overuse affects social interaction. Modern practices (design thinking, A-B testing, LCNC) emphasize quick prototyping and feedback adaptation over past survey-based usage studies.
A unified approach to IS use by sociotechnical and automated systems requires rethinking IS use, focusing not on HCI or stats but assuming IS users are work systems like hiring or sales systems. These systems, with or without human input, use IS resources to reach goals. IS value ties to its product/service contribution to work system goals. HCI and IT continuance factors remain relevant but secondary to work systems' IS use. The proposed ISUT applies to significant IS use in business, government, and personal contexts, shifting from questions on adoption and use continuance. It’s not explanatory but a systems theory, emphasizing IS system contexts. Unlike falsifiability, ISUT’s utility lies in its practical applicability to real IS use. The ISUT challenges basic IS concept definitions by applying a systems view, focusing on IS use's purpose, not causal user variables. This paper's structure presents the ISUT before critiquing IS research, enhancing understanding of ISUT's necessity and approach divergence.
This paper outlines: a summary of the background motivating ISUT development, introducing ISUT as an ontological theory with 3 axioms and 12 assumptions. It details ISUT’s context via systems, IS, and WST, exploring how IS use literature diverges from ISUT's assumptions. An agent framework aids applying ISUT, demonstrated by 4 examples. The conclusion stresses motivation, theory creation, presentation, and contribution.

## Background and Motivation

Current IS usage views, based on HCI metaphors (human interfaces with computers), are inadequate due to increasing automation. ISUT assumes IS usage within work systems, either human or automated entities (robots, chatbots, self-driving vehicles, etc.). Automated machines use IS for tasks like navigation and decision-making, where humans aren't direct users but are responsible for machine actions. IS usage should focus on activity, purpose, and value, rather than quantity like time spent online. Quantifying obvious concepts (ease of use, usefulness) offers little practical value; professionals find it uninsightful to state these influence IT use.
Vol 54 Paper 46: Re-Conceptualizing IS Usage as Usage by Work Systems. This paper expands IS usage theory using a work system perspective (Alter, 2013, 2022b). Some readers may find it unfamiliar as it isn't solely about IT. The work system perspective evolved from 1990s IS textbooks aimed at creating a practical method for analyzing IT systems in business. Alter's early articles highlighted this perspective: "Same Words, Different Meanings" (2000), "Are Fundamental Concepts of IS About Work Systems?" (2001), and others. Key concepts were clarified in Alter's 2006 book and 2008, 2013 articles. This paper leverages these ideas, proposing that ISs are types of work systems, supporting both sociotechnical and automated systems. It also synthesizes ideas from unpublished works, such as Alter's (2015, 2018) on adoption and compliance, and Laumer et al.'s (2019) view on IS user satisfaction. Alter (2021b) suggested reconceptualizing IS usage from a work system view, which this paper develops into the ISUT. The ISUT is ontological, aligning with Guarino & Giaretta (1995) and may integrate future IS research focused on ontologies (e.g., Wand & Weber, 1990; Recker et al., 2009; Guizzardi et al., 2022).
The ISUT includes 3 axioms (A1, A2, A3) and 12 assumptions (UA1-UA12) forming a systems view of IS usage. A1 defines IS usage, similar to service-dominant logic in marketing (Vargo & Lusch, 2016). Axioms highlight theoretical/practical issues ignored by prior work on IS usage, explained by assumptions. A1: IS usage is a WS's use of product/services from an IS. A2: Using an IS’s product/services involves IS roles/responsibilities during a WS’s operation. A3: IS roles/responsibilities pertain to WS tasks, directly or delegated to the IS.

UA1: A WS is where humans/machines perform work using info, tech, and resources to create product/services for internal/external customers. UA2: An IS is a WS mostly processing info (capture, store, retrieve, delete, transmit, manipulate, display). UA3: ISs serve other WSs. UA4: ISs/WSs act as entities that execute practices, projects, or programmed responses. UA5: Systems can be sociotechnical or fully automated. UA6: Sociotechnical WSs use IT tools; fully automated WSs use automated ISs, sometimes using sociotechnical ISs for collaboration. UA7: WSs have goals like efficiency, effectiveness, reliability, resilience, etc. (Alter, 2024). UA8: IS usage aims to achieve WS goals.
Burton-Jones et al. (206) note UA9: "Product/services" concept is better for IS usage as products can embody service features, and vice versa (Alter, 2010; Vargo & Lusch, 2004). UA10: IS usage might not always meet WS goals. UA11: Using an IS implies applying its products/services to WS activities. UA12: IS roles should be obvious to professionals for analysis or design, unlike unseen internal ISs like car ABS. Basic Concepts: ISUT uses system definitions (Ackoff, 1971) for WSs, ISs, projects, reflecting Churchman (1979), Checkland (1999). Skyttner (1996) views systems as subjective. ISUT usage is for active systems, not static structures, unlike tool-based IT research.
System usage as a dependent variable features in IS research like TAM (Davis, 1989), IS success model (DeLone & McLean, 1992; 2003), TTF (Goodhue & Thompson, 1995), and UTAUT (Venkatesh et al., 2003). Demetis & Lee (2017) critique that 'systems' in IS often just mean 'IT' or 'computer'. 

IS often lacks a definition of 'information'. ISUT considers information as both part and output of ISs, echoing Boell & Cecez-Kecmanovic’s (2015) views. Information may be intentional and contextually meaningful in WS. ISUT merges data, info, and knowledge, considering anything used/produced in WS as information. 

The ISUT concept is based on decades of work system theory (Alter, 1999-2013). 'Work' involves using resources (human, info, physical, financial) to produce outputs for humans or machines, not tied to careers. This includes business/societal settings but not personal activities like games. The work system unit is key for organizational systems, going back to Bostrom & Heinen (1977). WSs can be socio-technical or automated (UA1, UA5), operating in environments with necessary infrastructures and stakeholders. Businesses comprise multiple WSs for tasks like product development, customer acquisition, and coordination.
The WS concept applies to systems in organizations and homes. It's useful for typical WSs but not for trivial, ephemeral ones. Large enterprises can be seen as interacting WSs, not a single WS, which is less effective than models like value chains. WSs have special cases; principles for WSs apply to ISs, projects, etc. The main WS types are sociotechnical and fully automated. Sociotechnical WSs involve human-tech interaction to produce outputs, but humans aren't merely "users" due to the social-technical blend. Fully automated WSs handle tasks autonomously, like IoT and AI systems. All their value-adding activities are by hardware/software after activation. Designers/managers of sociotechnical WSs are participants if they contribute to outputs; builders of automated WSs are not participants but part of other WSs.
Information systems (ISs) are WSs focusing on info processing (capture, store, retrieve, delete, transmit, manipulate, display). Many ISs support other WSs like delivery ISs or factory ISs. ISs may include human participants or be fully automated. In accounting ISs, humans decide on transactions, using automated systems for storing info and reports. Fully automated IS examples: ad placement by tech or Clearview AI’s facial photo collection.

Projects are temporary WSs designed to produce outputs. IS development is a project, requiring scheduling, critical paths, and replanning.

Service systems serve internal/external customers, highlighting service mindset, value, relationships, and visibility, stressed in service science.

Self-service systems let customers use a provider’s resources for self-benefit, like e-commerce sites for product info and transactions, benefiting providers by reducing their tasks.

Supply chains/business ecosystems are inter-organizational WSs supplying resources for customers, but can be ineffective if overly complex.

WST, ISUT's foundation, describes/analyzes/designs/evaluates organizational systems, influenced by WSM, a SA&D method for professionals. WS definition reflects evolving human-machine collaboration.
Work system (WS): A system with humans/machines performing tasks using info, tech, and resources, producing products/services for internal/external customers or themselves.

The work system framework outlines nine elements defining a WS's form, function, and context, even amid changes. The work system life cycle model (WSLC) presents WS evolution via planned and unplanned changes, not just as simple projects. It involves four phases: initiation, development, implementation, then operation/maintenance, possibly leading to new cycles. Each WSLC phase has flexible subphases like software design, documentation, training, adaptable via agile/waterfall methods.

Clarifications: "Customers" are atop the framework as WSs exist for them. They can be external or internal participants in WSs (e.g., education, healthcare). "Product/services" replaces "outputs" to encompass customization and repetitive characteristics. "Processes/activities" replace "business processes" due to WS variability, reliant on participant judgment.

## ISUT's Boundary Conditions

Specifies where the theory applies effectively. It's apt for WSs spanning weeks/years, being significant/nontrivial. It’s less relevant for tiny/large WSs, short-lived, or too large for WS description. Figure 2 displays ISUT's areas based on WS scope/longevity, highlighting gaps in applicability, e.g., insignificant IS uses like gaming while waiting.
… 2) Large, short-term WS (e.g., emergency response) can be retrospectively analyzed by identifying participants, info, tech, and activities. 3) Small, long-term WS (e.g., daily breakfast) might use small ISs like timers but typically isn't useful for ISUT analysis. 4) Large, long-term WS (e.g., entire enterprise) sees little benefit from a WS analysis unless it focuses on a few interacting WSs to understand coordination. System usage in IS literature includes over 107 articles split into historical and contemporary understandings. ISUT views IS usage as a WS’s application of IS-produced services, contrasting common definitions. Since the 1970s, research focused on IT usage's discretionary nature, unlike ISUT’s applicable areas like mandatory corporate systems. TAM explores tech usage intentions; ISUT emphasizes ISs and WSs served rather than tech use itself, assuming TAM applies in voluntary tech usage.
IS success model: Original (1992) and updates (2003, 2013) by Delone & McLean attribute system and info quality as separate factors affecting use, user satisfaction, impacting individuals/orgs (1992) or net benefits (2013). The 2003 update adds service quality and intention to use. ISUT prioritizes WS usage. ISUT disagrees that info and system quality are separate, viewing IS as a WS. It stresses infrastructure rather than assuming more usage increases impacts/benefits, unlike traditional IS models.

Task/technology fit: Goodhue & Thompson (1995) argue task-tech alignment boosts performance/utilization, shown by a two-way arrow in the WS framework, which includes five such relationships. ISUT values all these alignments for WS efficiency/effectiveness.

Symbolic usage: Based on use cases in Davenport (1998), symbolic IS usage affects WS culture. ISUT focuses on WS operation, touching on symbolic aspects only occasionally.

UTAUT: Venkatesh et al. (2003) proposed UTAUT models, explaining IT use intent/behavior via constructs like performance expectancy and moderated by factors like age. UTAUT2 adapted this for consumers. A meta-analysis by Blut et al. (2022) found new predictors add value to usage explanation. ISUT focuses on IS usage nature rather than usage intent.

Measuring system usage: Burton-Jones (2005) proposed measures for system usage (e.g., extent, frequency). While ISUT focuses on system design, these measures are useful.
Vol 54 10.17705/1CAIS.05446 Paper 46

User-system-task: Burton-Jones & Straub (2006) reconceptualize system usage as an activity with: (1) user (using IS), (2) system (used object), (3) task (performed function). System usage is distinct from info usage, suggesting info isn’t part of used systems, contrary to WS user experiences. Table 1 compares their definition with ISUT’s IS usage definition.

Table 1: IS usage definitions comparison

User: Defined as a person using IS; expanded to include groups/orgs. WSs are direct IS users (Axiom A1), can be sociotechnical or automated.

System: IS provides task domain representations; IS in WS serves with roles beyond representations (Axioms A2, A3 and agent-responsibility framework).

Task: Defined as goal-directed by user; expanded to WS or its agents' activities (Axiom A3).

Multilevel usage: Individual & collective use shouldn’t be separate. Need to understand inter-use relationships, including function and context. ISUT says WS using IS might be sociotechnical/automated and itself not an IS (UA1, UA5, UA2).

Effective use theory: Defined as system usage aiding goal achievement with dimensions: transparent interaction, representational fidelity, informed action. Best for accounting, transaction systems; less relevant for others (e.g., ML-based IS). ISUT sees goals as serving WSs, aiming for efficiency/effectiveness and other objectives (UA3, UA7, UA8).
Contextual theories of effective use: Burton-Jones and Volkoff (2017) suggest context-specific effective use theories, focusing on how affordance networks support goals, affordance actualization, and inductive theorizing. They highlight effective use as accuracy, consistency, and reflection-in-action. Unlike contextual theories, ISUT is a broad theory. Future ISUT extensions might explore affordances for WS.

Collective IS use theory: Negoita et al. (2018) call for clarity in understanding collective IS use, defining it as a unit-focused construct from individual IS use in common work processes. Their typology includes siloed, processual, coalesced, and networked use. ISUT encompasses these but doesn't detail them, assuming IS use involves or doesn't involve individual use or a common work process. It allows for disjointed tasks within a WS using the same IS.

Agentic IS usage: Baird and Maruping (2021) explore delegation to agentic IS artifacts, software agents with perception and action abilities, involved in task rights and outcome responsibilities. ISUT treats IS use as IS product/service use by WSs it serves, involving agent responsibility frameworks and acknowledging both IS and WS as sociotechnical or automated. Delegation among IS/WS is recognized, including rational software agents.

The selected articles show fundamental differences between ISUT and most IS usage literature, with ISUT viewing WSs as primary IS users in complex scenarios, where direct IS interactors act as WS agents, seen even in e-commerce contexts. HCI ideas are crucial, as user-friendly interfaces aid task performance, while poor interfaces hinder it.

## Roles of Algorithmic Agents and Responsibilities

Axioms A1, A2, A3 state IS usage occurs when IS performs roles related to work facets in a WS. This section elaborates ISUT’s approach combining roles and work facets in an agent responsibility framework to clarify practical applications of these axioms.

### Roles Delegated to IS by Work Systems:
- Monitoring the WS: May lack direct WS involvement, used for management info, worker safety, or surveillance.
- Providing info: Via documents, reports, datasets, recordings, or videos.
- Enabling capabilities: For info analysis or creating/analyzing models.
- Controlling activities: Through nudges, feedback, rule enforcement, alarms, or manager notifications.
- Coproducing activities: Roles shared between IS and WS via user/device-driven dialogues or mixed interactions.
- Executing activities: Automated IS performs WS tasks or WS tasks outsourced to external IS.

### Facets of Work:
Facets describe and analyze IS use by WSs, like decision-making and info processing. This extension of work system theory aids stakeholder interactions in system analysis/design, inspired by how a diamond's facets can be viewed and analyzed.
All 18 facets of work in Table 2 apply to any WS, linked to concepts, evaluation criteria, design trade-offs, sub-facets, and open-ended queries for analysis and design (Alter, 2021a, pp. 323-331). Some overlap, e.g., decisions and communication. Iterative design for these facets might have resulted in 14 or 27 facets. Inclusion as a facet was based on its association with concepts, criteria, trade-offs, sub-facets, and questions useful in analysis/design. Facets specify requirements for capabilities often overlooked in IS contexts.

Table 1 lists 18 facets: 
- Decision-making, Communication, Info provision, Reality representation, Learning, Coordination, Physical work, Service, Knowledge application, Planning, Improvisation, Support work performance, Value creation, Thinking, Execution control, Info processing, Social interaction, Security maintenance.

Facets aren't assumed independent; e.g., decision-making involves communication, learning, info processing. Each facet serves as a lens for WSs using ISs.

The AR framework (Fig 3) helps identify IS service roles via WS facets. It clarifies IS roles/responsibilities in WSs, stating IS usage occurs when IS roles (horizontal) relate to work facets (vertical). Emerging from years of discussion on work facets, service, agency, it sees IS roles as services in WS activities. Design choices involve selecting work facets IS should serve, identifying IS roles for WS, assigning IS responsibilities for work facets. These are WS-delegated, not IS or corporate governance-related.

Six facets in Fig 3 (e.g., decision-making involves info processing, communication) represent examples from the 18 facets. All could be included, but that complicates visualization. Combining AR dimensions pinpoints design issues (e.g., monitoring decision-making responsibility).

### Table 3: IS Role Application to Work Facets in EMR Context

| Work Facet            | IS Role           | Application                                                                            |
|-----------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Making decisions      | monitor           | IS monitors clinical decisions for standard adherence, equitable treatment.             |
| Communicating         | provide info      | IS expedites staff communication.                                                      |
| Processing info       | provide capabilities | IS reduces data, visualizes for effortless physician processing.                      |
| Coordinating          | control activities | IS ensures standard adherence in patient problem lists coordination.                    |
| Creating value        | coproduce activities | IS aids value creation via joint condition/treatment monitoring.                      |
| Maintaining security  | execute activities | IS maintains security/privacy, monitors electronic messages.                           |

The AR framework suggests IS roles/facets can be tailored to specific situations rather than exhaust all combinations. Designers should focus on relevant combinations for each WS.

## ISUT Application to Four Examples

ISUT's usefulness is evaluated through new IS usage insights across four different IS cases, each beyond routine uses. Inspired by perceived gaps in IT adoption discussions, these examples highlight ISUT's applicability, with further analysis possible on ISUT's three axioms and 12 assumptions.
These ISs include EMR, SMgt, AdEx, and MCAS. The first two are vital in corporate environments. The third is a fully automated WS also an IS with many sub-ISs. The fourth, a cyber-physical WS, had an IS fail significantly. Other examples related to hidden Internet infrastructure apply ISUT somewhat but offer few insights.

### 7.1 An EMR System:
In Gawande's case, a major EMR implementation affected a 70,000-staff medical group. Benefits included standardization and patient access to records. Yet, primary care doctors experienced burnout, spending excessive personal time on data entry, encountering "signal fatigue," with irrelevant alerts requiring human sorting. EMR led to disconnection and less collaboration. Some roles shifted to "scribes" for data entry, including doctors in India supporting Boston physicians. The EMR IS overlaps with the medical WS, prompting documentation stress over patient care. An ISUT perspective emphasizes issues beyond an HCI focus.

### 7.2 Workarounds in a Mandated Enterprise System:
SMgt, a spreadsheet-based sales management system, was a workaround to an ERP system deemed unusable in Hong Kong's branches due to storage constraints. The ERP logic didn't fit Hong Kong's conditions, where four stores used a central warehouse for replenishment orders and customer deliveries, differing from headquarter expectations.
HK staff created SMgt, a spreadsheet sales mgmt sys, to bypass corp ERP for HK ops. SMgt allows 4 stores to manage inventory, sales, deliveries apart from corp ERP, used only for inventory replenishment and sales reporting. Thus, corp ERP was partly used and bypassed. Answering typical ERP use Qs would mislead. ISUT helps describe this as WSs (order receiving, selling, order fulfilling) managed by 2 ISs: ERP for HQ communication and SMgt for HK stores. Focusing solely on HCI wouldn't fully capture IS usage here.

Modern aircraft, as complex cyber-physical systems, use software for control. The crew's operations are seen as a WS delivering passengers. Responsibilities were assigned to MCAS, an automated IS handling aerodynamic status and raising the plane's nose, even overriding pilots. Malfunctions led to tragic outcomes. ISUT's axioms highlight key WS tasks like info processing, decision-making, and physical work, noting issues where pilots couldn't counteract MCAS manually. Design phase review might show misalignment between MCAS and pilots, overlooked joint responsibilities, lack of MCAS feedback from pilots, and potential MCAS issues due to bad sensor data. The ISUT examples demonstrate deeper insights into IS usage beyond typical literature approaches.
ISUT development stemmed from a need for an integrated view of IS usage amid increasing IT and automation. Current definitions of IS usage lack consistency despite its importance. A comprehensive approach is needed to analyze IS usage across contexts. Theory creation, as Weick suggested, involves disciplined imagination. ISUT integrated concepts from research on work systems, bypassing formal literature reviews. Inspired by curiosity about IS limitations, ISUT evolved through iterations, benefiting from feedback on earlier drafts. Jaccard & Jacoby's idea of abstracting concrete instances to theoretical constructs guided development. Unlike typical IS theories using variance or process models, ISUT employs a systems perspective, aligning with Burton-Jones' view on the relevance of systems theories for IS studies.
8.3 Theory Presentation and Content This paper illustrates ISUT's depth and cohesion, using a nonstandard flow to help readers grasp how varied sources contributed to its articulation. Early presentation of ISUT was deemed apt due to inconsistent definition and use in IS literature and its unfamiliar system theory nature. It critiques past "system usage" applications, using a systems view to clarify vaguely defined concepts in IS literature. The paper emphasizes Whetten's second-order explanations and contextual assumptions, detailing ISUT's axioms and assumptions. It compares ISUT to key IS literature concepts and introduces an agent responsibility framework. Four examples show ISUT's real-world applicability. Highlighting ISUT as a systems and ontological theory, it treats ISs and WSs as interconnected systems. Its domain-specific concepts are ontological yet narrower than broader ontologies. ISUT presentation aligns with Bacharach's criteria of falsifiability and utility, emphasizing internal consistency and fitting within work system theory. It highlights areas where ISUT ideas have less value and emphasizes potential utility with real-world cases that require future validation in educational and practical settings. 8.4 Contribution This paper's key theoretical contribution is a new perspective on a central IS construct. It offers a structured yet flexible approach for in-depth IS usage analysis, benefiting practitioners and researchers. ISUT's system-oriented view could impact system analysis, design, professional IS discussions, instruction, and future research.
Practice Contributions: ISUT offers insights for detailed IS usage descriptions and for analyzing design, implementation, and usage patterns. Viewing IS usage via roles in work systems can guide IS development beyond conventional methods. It explores responsibilities across roles, identifying hidden issues. Tools like BPMN document process flows but miss aspects for visualizing sociotechnical and automated systems, unlike ISUT, which integrates those. Relying on user stories might overlook how ISs enhance work systems' efficiency and effectiveness. ISUT also applies to automated systems overlooked by user stories. It supports IS implementation with feedback on management's goals for IS's impact on work systems. Practitioners showed its efficacy with 700+ management briefings by MBA/EMBA students (2003-2017) via WSM. ISUT could enhance WSM or a systems analysis toolkit (Alter & Bork, 2020) from a work system view.

Research Contributions: ISUT challenges existing IS usage views, differing from variance/process theories. It unifies IS usage insights across sociotechnical and automated systems, aiming to integrate ideas for describing, analyzing, and evaluating IS usage in all sectors. Despite diverse ISs, ISUT seeks comprehensive understanding. Its uniqueness brings research opportunities/challenges:
- As a rare systems theory, it offers comparison points for different theories.
- It questions ambiguities in IS definitions, starting with system, information, extending to IT artifacts.
- It challenges theories like UTAUT and IS success model, advocating for more descriptive IS usage analysis.
- ISUT's view of IS usage as serving a work system could further develop IS service-orientation, enhancing IS usage research via a service approach.  
- ISUT may enhance or challenge user satisfaction findings in Laumer et al. (2019).  
- ISUT can underpin case studies and action research by identifying IS usage forms and purposes, potentially improving ISUT.  
- ISUT and work system perspectives could form an IS-centric theory for design science research, aiding in IS tool/method development, stakeholder engagement, and issue resolution.
