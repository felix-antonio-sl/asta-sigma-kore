Abstract. Reflecting  the  IFIP  8.6  theme  of “cocreating  for  context,”  this conceptual  contribution
proposes  a model  designed  to  support  co-creation  within  an  unfolding  context  of  varying  internal  and
external  conditions  as  a  digital  transformation  (DT)  strives  to  achieve  its  goals. It  proposes  a  digital
transformation  progress  model  (DTPM) that  combines  a work  system  perspective  with  ideas  related  to
DT, including DT initiative, DT success, phases of DT, and tangible  and intangible  resources for change
that affect DT initiatives. The model expresses the combined impact of the favorability of five categories
of  resources  for  change  at  any  point  in  a  DT  initiative’s  trajectory.  The  categories  are  momentum,
capabilities,  forces,  drivers  and  impediments  of  change,  and  catalysts  of  change.  Potential  uses  of  the
DTPM and follow-on research are discussed briefly.

1 Digital Transformation as Co-Creating for Context
“Co-creating for context,” the theme of the 2022 IFIP 8.6 conference, emphasizes the increasing diversity,
complexity,  and  uncertainty  of  context(s)  influencing  the  diffusion  of  emerging  IT.  The CFP  discusses
many possible topics including what is happening “at the precipice of digital transformation.”  This paper
pursues the topic of digital transformation (DT) as a prime example of “co-creating for context.”
This conceptual  contribution proposes a digital transformation progress model (DTPM) for supporting
co-creation  as  a  DT  initiative  unfolds  within  a context  of  time-varying  internal  and  external  conditions.
Traditional  project  management  approaches  emphasizing  Gantt  chart  topics  would miss  many  issues  and
obstacles  that  could  affect  the  initiative’s  trajectory  as  a  co-creation  effort  within  diverse  contexts.  The
DTPM  combines  project  status  and  momentum  information  with  subjective  judgments  related  to  issues
and obstacles likely to affect the initiative’s current status, future trajectory, and possible outcomes.
The proposed DTPM assumes that DT occurs through change trajectories in IT-enabled mission-critical
work  systems  (WSs). It assumes  that the general phenomenon  of  DT is not linked  to specific  emerging
technologies  such  as cloud  computing, blockchain, and machine  learning.  It  does  not incorporate DT
mantras  about maintaining  visible leadership by  top  executives,  improving  digital  literacy, and changing
corporate  culture,  nor  does  it suggest  a  normative  DT  process or  assume  that  DT  necessarily  involves
strategic responses to technology-related disruptions in industry or society.
Goal.  This  paper  proposes a  model-based approach  for  supporting  or  analyzing  co-creation  as  a  DT
initiative  strives  to  achieve  its  goals  within  the  unfolding  context  of  varying  internal  and  external
conditions.
A  revised  version  of  this  draft  was presented  at  the IFIP 8.6  Working  Conference  on Co-creating  for  Context  in
Prospective  Transfer  &  Diffusion  of  IT on  June  15,  2022.  Proceedings  of  that  Conference will  be published in  the
Springer  book  series  IFIP Advances  in  Information  and  Communication  Technology.  The  editors  of  that  volume  are
Amany Elbana, Shane McLoughlin, Yogesh  Dwivedi,  David  Wastell,  and  Brian  Donnellan.   The  final publication will
be available at <http://dx.doi.org/[DOI> to be inserted after it is assigned].  
Organization.    Section  2  summarizes  the  work  system  perspective  because DT  calls  for  significant
changes  in  mission-critical  work  systems. Section  3  presents  definitions and  other  ideas  related  to  DT.
Section 4 explains how the DTPM links the favorability of five categories of resources for change to a DT
initiative’s likelihood  of  successful  outcomes throughout its  evolving  trajectory.  Section  5  briefly
discusses potential uses of the DTPM. Section 6 identifies limitations and follow-on research.
The DTPM was developed through an iterative process incorporating interests and research experiences
related to DT, value co-creation, work systems, implementation case studies, and the resource-based view.
Many of this paper’s ideas are presented without detailed background explanations that would be expected
in a full journal article but would exceed this paper’s length limitations.
2 Work System Perspective Underlying the DTPM
Brief background summarizing  existing  coverage  of  the work  system  perspective (WSP) [1,  2,  3] is
needed  since the DTPM focuses on  initiatives  related  to  mission-critical  WSs  as  defined  within  that
perspective. The WSP has been used in teaching (e.g., [4, 5, 6]) and in research articles on various topics,
but I am not aware of its use in models for supporting DT.  
Definition of work system.  A WS is a system in which human participants and/or machines perform
work  (processes  and  activities)  using  information,  technology,  and  other  resources  to  produce  specific
product/services  for  internal  and/or  external  customers.  WSs  may  be  sociotechnical  (human  participants
perform work with  help  of  machines)  or  totally  automated  (machine  perform  all work). ISs,  projects,
highly focused supply chains, and totally automated WSs can be viewed and analyzed as WSs.  
Definition of information system. An IS is a  WS whose  essential activities are  devoted  to capturing,
storing,  retrieving,  transmitting,  deleting,  manipulating,  and  displaying  information.  ISs  may  exist  to
produce their own product/services or may exist to support other WSs. The notion of essential activities is
analogous to the idea of deep structure in representation theory [7].  
Work  system  view of an enterprise.  An  enterprise (or  major business  unit or  supply  chain crossing
enterprises)  can  be  viewed  as a  set  of  WSs whose  operation  and  interactions  maintains  the  enterprise,
determines  how it  obtains  and  applies resources,  and  produces  product/services  for customers  and
economic results for the enterprise.
Aspects  of a work  system  that  may  change  during  DT. The  nine  elements  of  the work  system
framework  (Fig. 1)  are  viewed  as  changeable  in  the  course  of  DT  initiatives.  The  elements  of  that
framework outline a basic understanding of a WS’s form, function, and environment during a period when
it  is  stable  enough  to  retain  its  identity even  though  incremental  changes  may  occur. Processes  and
activities, participants,  information,  and technologies are  completely  within  the  WS. Customers and
product/services may  be  partially  inside  and  partially  outside  because  customers  often  participate in
activities within a WS and because product/services take shape within a WS. Environment, infrastructure,
and strategies are viewed as outside of the WS even though they have direct effects within a WS and may
be  affected  by  a  significant  DT  initiative. “Elements  of  the  WS  framework”  will  be referred  to as  “WS
elements” even though the last three are partially or totally outside and not controllable by a WS.
Fig. 1. Work System Framework  

Fig. 2. Work system life cycle model
The WS life cycle model (WSLC – Fig. 2) describes how WSs (including ISs) evolve through iterations
of planned  change  through  projects (initiation,  development,  and  implementation  phases) and unplanned
change (adaptations  and  workarounds).  Significant  changes  affect  multiple  elements  of  the  WS
framework, not just technologies. The  development phase creates or acquires and then tests software  and
other  resources  needed  for  implementation  in  the  organization. The  implementation  phase  involves
changes in work practices. The WSLC’s four idealized phases (and their sub-phases) express a waterfall-
like  approach  to  identifying  things  that  should  happen  as  a  WS  evolves  iteratively. Key  activities  and
responsibilities  remain even  if  the  phases  are  partially  merged  in  agile  approaches  and  regardless  of
whether the WS uses homegrown software, commercial application software, or external platforms. Even
when  development  and  implementation  are  partly  merged,  each  iteration  determines  requirements  (at
some  level  of  detail),  acquires,  produces,  fixes, tests, and  debugs  any  needed  software,  decides  how  to
implement WS changes, identifies implementation problems, and trains WS participants.
3 Ideas for Understanding Digital Transformations
The effort to develop a DTPM was motivated by the increasing importance of DT and my unawareness
of models  that might  support  DT  initiatives  more  effectively  than  project  management,  change
management, and IT portfolio management models.  
The comprehensive  DT literature  review in [8] made  further review  seem redundant.  It found 282 DT
articles,  of  which  only  28  defined  DT.  Many  definitions  had  significant  shortcomings  related  to
“circularity, unclear concepts, and conflation between the concept and its impacts” (p. 119). [8] defined
DT as “a process that aims to improve an entity by triggering significant changes to its properties through
combinations of information, computing, communication, and connectivity technologies.” (p. 118). Later
[8,  p.  122]  expanded on  that  definition  by  noting  eight  “building  blocks  of  the  DT  process” in the
literature: strategic responses, disruptions, use of digital technologies, structural changes, changes in value
creation  paths,  organizational  barriers,  negative  impacts,  and  positive  impacts. This  paper  recognizes the
relevance  of  those  factors, while  proposing a  model  designed  to  help managers  trying  to  steer a DT
initiative.
3.1 Developing the DT Progress Model  
Inspection  of current  DT-related  articles  and consultant web  sites  concluded that a  useful model  of  DT
needed to  start  with  a  clear  definition  of  DT, should support  DT  initiatives, and ideally should  help
researchers  visualize  DT  issues. It  should  go  beyond  recycling  common  assertions  about  management
support,  experience,  adequate  resources,  realistic  scheduling, disruptions, and emerging  technologies.  
Developing a  DT  model  based  on the WSP seemed  more  straightforward  than  using institutional  theory,
technological  change,  strategy  analysis,  diffusion  of  innovation,  or other  approaches because  DT
necessarily involves changes in work systems.  
My initial  attempt  to  imagine  a  DTPM  applied aspects  of the WSP  including work  system  theory
(WST) and the work system method (WSM), a related systems analysis method designed to help business
professionals visualize WSs  and  collaborate  effectively  with  IT  professionals.  The  general  idea  of
applying a WS lens to mission-critical WSs seemed plausible but an initial descriptive application of WST
and WSM said nothing unique about DT. The next step was trying to describe how DT initiatives call for
new  extensions  or  combinations  of  WS-related  understandings  in [1,  2,  3,  4]. The  search  for  richer
conceptualizations touched  on empirical  studies [9,  10], views  of  innovation [11], discussions of forces
[12,  13],  the  resource-based  view [14],  dynamic  capabilities  [15], a new framework  for  describing
theoretical  perspectives  [16]  and  its  application  to  the WSP[17]. Trial  and  error  iterations  in developing
the new model included some aspects of design science research but did not use DSR explicitly.
3.2 Definitions Related to DT and DT Initiative
The DTPM builds on definitions from WST and on definitions related to DT.
Definition of DT. Enterprises serve their customers through the operation and interactions of numerous
WSs.  Accordingly,  DT  is  defined  as  an  enterprise-level  transformation which  IT-related  changes  enable
strategically  significant  changes  in  mission-critical WSs .   Thus,  DT  is neither about the  diffusion  of IT
nor  about  industrial  or  societal  changes inspired  or  enabled  by IT. DT  typically  focuses  on  selected
mission-critical WSs, not on the entire enterprise, and not on shared IT infrastructure unless infrastructure
changes enable significant changes in mission-critical WSs. DT-related changes during DT initiatives are
typically  directed  toward some  combination  of  major  business  concerns  such  as operational  excellence,
profitability, product/services for customers, and/or the customer experience.  
Definition  of  DT  initiative. An  identifiable  DT  initiative  involves  the  initiation,  oversight,  and
management of one or more DT-related projects from inception to completion or abandonment. Applying
a project viewpoint to DT initiatives assumes that typical project details such as schedules, dependencies,
and  resources  will  be  articulated  clearly,  tracked,  and  possibly  adjusted  as  conditions  change.  As  with
many  large  projects,  DT  initiatives  may  be  merged  into  other  projects  or  may  be  terminated  before
achieving their goals.  
Time frame for DT.  Viewed in project-like terms, a DT initiative has a start date, a set of milestones
that help in tracking progress, and a projected date of completion that may be revised.  
DT  as  an adjustable  trajectory.    The  planned  trajectory  of  an  ongoing  DT  effort  (including  timing,
intermediate  milestones,  intended  end  points,  and  human,  technical,  and  financial  resources)  may  be
modified  during  a  DT  initiative  based  on  its  current  status  and  assessments  of opportunities,  constraints,
and other concerns.  
Success of a DT initiative. This is described in two ways, both of which recognize that DT initiatives
are large, complex projects whose ambitions and scope may change due to opportunities and/or constraints
that were not recognized initially. The first view of success describes the extent to which projects in a DT
initiative are completed on schedule and absorb an appropriate amount of human, technical, and financial
resources  in  creating  or  modifying  mission-critical  WSs  in  accordance  with  original  or  revised
transformational  visions.    The  second  view  of  success  focuses  on  the  extent  to  which  new  or  improved
WSs  achieve  and  sustain  the  transformational  vision  and  eventually  are  extended.  Both  views  of  success
call for subjective assessments that may differ between observers.  
3.3 Phases of a Digital Transformation
The  phases  of  a  DT  can be  viewed  as  a  5-phase  variation  on  the  WSLC  that  nonetheless  recognizes  that
iterations and overlaps between phases may occur [11]:

1. Impetus.  Recognition of enterprise-level challenges that a DT could try to address.
2. Transformational vision. The management vision of how those challenges will be addressed and what
outcomes will be achieved
3. Resource acquisition. The process of creating, obtaining, improving, and/or channeling resources that
are needed for DT implementation  
4. Implementation.  Making WS changes needed to achieve the transformational vision
5. Operation and maintenance. Operation and support of transformed WSs.
Identifying  general  phases  of  DT  initiatives  distinguishes  those  initiatives  from  less  specific  diffusion  of
technological  innovation  or  societal  change related  to innovative  technologies.  Executing  DT  initiatives
requires that their transformational vision will be translated into projects that acquire and use resources to
create  or  improve  mission-critical  WSs.  A  DT  initiative  without  well-defined  projects is  more like a
management  exhortation that  lacks  operational  follow-through.  The  nature  and  scope  of  projects  within
DT  initiatives  may  evolve  over  time,  especially  since DT  initiatives  typically  are  undertaken  in  dynamic
business contexts where needs and ambitions that  launched a  DT initiative  might be  overtaken by events
in the surrounding context(s) or might evolve based on experience within the initiative.
3.4 Resources for a Digital Transformation  
The  idea  of  “resources  for  change”  has  been  used  in  a  variety  of  ways  in  relation  to  management,
education,  law,  medicine,  social  relationships,  organizational  change,  and  elsewhere. Many  iterations  of
trying to apply various aspects of the WSP to DT initiatives led to visualizing five types of “resources for
change”  that  contribute  to  whether  and  how  DT  initiatives  will  achieve  their  goals.    Largely  tangible
resources  for  change  include    (1)  momentum  toward  the  transformational  vision  and  (2)  capabilities
needed  to  achieve  the  vision.  Intangible  resources  include  (3)  forces  affecting  all  or  most  of  a  WS,  (4)
drivers and impediments of change related to specific WS elements, and (5) catalysts affecting the micro-
dynamics  of  DT-related  changes.  Each  of  type  of  resource  has  many  different  facets  that  may  have
positive,  neutral,  or  negative  impacts  on  current  and  future  progress  of  projects  within  the  DT  initiative.
The  various  facets  of  the  five  types  of  resources  for  change  typically are  not  totally  independent.    Most
managers  probably  would  ignore  that  issue  if  the  larger  categories  helped  them  identify  and  collaborate
around important concerns.  
Momentum toward the Transformational Vision. A specific WS’s DT-related momentum is the extent
to  which  its  current  state  and  the  state  of  ongoing  projects  that  affect  it  are consistent with  the  current
schedule  and  the  DT’s  transformational  vision  (which  both  may  have  been  revised). Typical  ideas  in
project management focus on those concerns, which are expressed in project management tools that focus
on  project  status,  future  milestones,  available  human,  financial,  technical,  and  informational  resources,
and key dependencies along the critical path to the project’s conclusion.
Shared  enthusiasm  and  significant  progress  toward  the  goal  can  be  viewed  as  resources  that  reinforce
shared beliefs that the goal makes sense and is attainable. Conversely, participants in a project that seems
adrift  may  tend  to  believe  that  their  efforts  are  pointless  and  will  not  pay  off  for  themselves  or  for  the
organization.
Capabilities Needed  to  Achieve  the  Transformational  Vision. DT  requires  a  combination  of
appropriate software development and implementation capabilities, financial capabilities (adequate budget
and  financial  systems  and  flexibility)  and trustworthy  leadership  and  organizational  change  capabilities
(e.g., dynamic capabilities defined in [15] as “the firm’s ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal
and external  competences to address rapidly changing environments”).  Low  levels of capabilities of any
of  those  types  imply  that  a DT  initiative  likely  requires  additional  inputs  of  energy,  time,  money,
personnel, and/or technical resources.
Management  responses  to  inadequate  capabilities  are  often  more  difficult  than  simply  acquiring
additional staffing or funding.  For example, inadequate technical capabilities call for bringing new people
into the project, which is often difficult because time spent bringing new project participants up to speed is
time not spent on completing ongoing tasks [18].
Forces Affecting a Work System as a Whole. The idea of forces and force fields as discussed by Lewin
[12] is not common in the IS field even though it has been used to describe a struggle between driving and
restraining forces, e.g., in software  development firms [19]. Also, Porter’s five forces model [13] is used
widely  to  describe business competition. The  idea  of  thinking  about  forces  in  relation  to  the  WSP
originally came from an extended analogy with physics [16] and was discussed in  [17].
Fig. 3 identifies five types of forces that may have positive or negative impacts on DT-related changes
in a WS.  
• Cohesive forces tend to hold WSs together, e.g., incentives, goals, controls, alignment. Five alignment
arrows within the work system framework (Fig. 1)  highlight typical paths for cohesive forces.
• Innovative  forces aligned  with  the  transformational  vision propel  the  progress  of  DT  initiatives
because they support coordination and maintain direction.  
• Disruptive  forces tend  to  impede  DT  initiatives by dissipating energy and sometimes  degrading WSs
significantly.  e.g.,  internal  misalignments,  discontent,  poor  management,  design  flaws. Those  issues
mirror  the  idea  of  entropy  from  physics,  i.e., a  generalized  type  of  disruptive  force that increases
disorder.
• Inertial forces impede  progress  by  dissipating  energy  and  resisting  planned  or  unplanned  changes  in
WS  operation. Organizational  inertia  is  cited  frequently a  key challenge  in overcoming resistance to
change, e.g., in organizational behavior, general management, and systems dynamics, where the related
phenomenon is called policy resistance ([20, pp. 5-12]).
• Forces  at  a  distance (analogous  to  gravity)  may  propel  or  impede  progress  toward  DT  goals.  These
forces  stem  from  broad  phenomena  related  to  economics,  competition,  regulation,  demographics,  and
technological change. Such forces may not be apparent to participants in mission-critical WSs that have
operated adequately for years but are not aligned with a DT initiative’s requirements or goals.
Fig. 3. Five types of forces that may affect a DT
Drivers  and  Impediments  Related  to  WS  Elements.  In  contrast  with  forces  in  Fig. 3 that  apply  to  an
entire  WS,  many drivers  or  impediments of change  are  related  to individual  WS  elements [11] and
sometimes  are  reminiscent  of  some  of  the  factors  in  UTAUT  [21,22].  Fig. 4 shows  typical examples  of
such factors, all of which are expressed so they can be drivers or impediments for DT. For example, low
customer  satisfaction  could  be  a  driver  of  DT  while high  customer  satisfaction  might  impede  DT  by
making  the  need  for  change  less  evident. Similarly,  the  motivation  and  ambitions  of  WS  participants
might  have  positive  or  negative  impacts  depending  on  how  well  the  DT  initiative  is  aligned  with  those
motivations and ambitions.  
Many  factors  in  the  IS  literature  on  post-adoption  behavior  can  be  viewed  as  drivers  or  impediments
related  to  WS  elements.  The  drivers  and  impediments  in  Fig.  4  include  many  factors  that  go  beyond  the
variables  that  appear  in  the  most  widely  cited  IS  theories  (e.g.,  TAM,  UTAUT)  that  focus  mostly  on
determinants of technology acceptance and use rather than on IT-enabled changes in mission-critical WSs.
Fig. 4. Drivers and impediments related to elements of the work system framework
Some of the factors in Fig. 4 overlap somewhat with forces in Fig. 3. For example, Fig. 3’s forces from
a  distance include  competition,  and  Figure 4’s  factors  related  to  the  WS  element environment include
competitive  pressure.  That  type  of  overlap  is  not  surprising  since  forces  that  affect  an  entire  WS
necessarily  involve  factors  that  affect  one  or  more  of  its  elements.    For  current  purposes,  thinking
separately about forces affecting an entire WS and factors related to specific WS elements is a potentially
useful for visualizing a DT initiative’s status and prognosis.  
Catalysts  Affecting  the  Micro-dynamics  of  DT.  Consideration  of  micro-dynamics  of DT  is  needed
because  day-to-day  activities  often  reflect  expressed  or  unexpressed  beliefs  that  may  support  or  resist  a
DT  initiative.  Micro-dynamics  can  be  described  in  terms  of  three  catalysts, needing,  understanding, and
liking, that  affect the  cooperation vs. resistance of WS participants and other stakeholders [11]. The  verb
forms needing, understanding, and liking are  used  instead  of  psychological  terms  such  as  affective or
rational  because  they  express  ideas  more  directly  in  relation  to  innovation,  adoption,  and  adaptation  in
organizational  settings. Positive  perceptions  related  to needing,  understanding,  and liking tend  to  be
positive for DT, although with some exceptions.  
• Needing.  This  is  the  extent  to  which  individuals  or  groups  perceive  that  they need  an    innovation  for
achieving their own goals. Greater perceived need usually leads to greater support of an innovation.
• Understanding. This is the extent to which individuals or groups understand how an innovation can (or
cannot) be applied and how  and why it might (or might not) be beneficial. Greater understanding may
or  may  not  be  associated  with  acceptance  or  rejection  of  an  innovation.  The  simplest  cases  are  when
people  accept or reject an innovation because  they understand its genuine benefits or shortcomings. In
other cases, people  who  understand an innovation’s beneficial impact for an enterprise might reject it
due  to conflicts with personal  or  group  goals  or  interests.  (Remember  the  Luddites.)  Similarly,  people
who misunderstand an innovation might accept it because they cannot foresee its negative implications
for them or their group.
• Liking.  This  is  the  extent  to  which  individuals  or  groups  like  an  innovation.  It  is  easier  to  implement
innovations that are liked. Implementation efforts tend to be more painful and costly in time and effort
when innovations are disliked.
Issues  related  to  micro-dynamics  may  reveal  problems  that  are  obstacles  to  achieving  DT  benefits.
Various  forms  of  resistance  ranging  from  benign  neglect  to  low-level  sabotage could  determine  whether
the  DT  initiative  will  be  embraced  and  implemented  fully,  especially  when  WS  participants,  managers,
and other stakeholders have conflicting perceptions and beliefs about whether a DT initiative will improve
work conditions, will require different skills, or might cause layoffs.
3.5 Resource Favorability
Google  Scholar  found  no  instances  of  papers  that  contained  both resource  favorability and digital
transformation even  though  it  found  some  instances  of resource  favorability in  relation to mineral
resource projects and several other topics.  
The DTPM uses resource favorability to summarize the extent to which specific resources or groups of
resources for change at any point during a DT initiative’s trajectory seem likely to contribute positively
(or  negatively)  to  likely  success  for  specific  WSs.  The  favorability  of  those  resources  can  be  explained
based  on  examples,  described  qualitatively  based  on  subjective  perceptions,  or  rated  numerically  in
various  ways.  Numerical favorability ratings  afford  aggregation  of  otherwise  incommensurate  factors,
although  meaningful  aggregations  require  careful  attention  to  the  relative  importance  of  different
resources and to dependencies and other relationships.  
Resource favorability is perceived differently for the five different types of resources for change in Fig.
3. Favorability  perceptions  related  to  momentum  might  be  based  on  information  in  a  project  scorecard,
e.g., progress vs. plan, critical path to completion, and so on. Favorability related to capabilities might be
expressed  similarly  based  on likely  availability  of human  and  technical  resources.  Favorability  related  to
forces, WS-specific drivers/impediments, and WS catalysts might be understood most effectively through
narrative  evidence  obtained  through  surveys,  interviews,  management  meetings,  or  other information
collection. Stories and examples often would be important, e.g., when  a DT initiative’s momentum might
seem favorable until a key vendor loses technical experts, leading to the management challenge of finding
and evaluating alternatives  quickly.  A  different  approach  would  express  resource  favorability  using
numerical scales that summarize situations without collecting a lot of detailed information.
For  current purposes,  a  favorability  rating  for  the  current  state  of  any  specific  resource  is  a  point  on a
continuous  dimension  going  from  extremely  unfavorable  to  extremely favorable  for  the  successful
completion of the DT initiative. Perceptions on that type of scale could be collected by using a slider that
makes  it  unnecessary  to  focus  on  numerical  distinctions  (e.g.,  4.6  vs.  5.2  out  of  7)  that  might  not  matter
when  aggregated  perceptions  of multiple individuals.  Table  2  will  illustrate  how  the  slider  could  use
colors  such  as  red  for  unfavorable,  yellow  for neutral, green  for  favorable,  and  slider inputs  from people
providing  favorability  ratings could  be  converted  to  numerical scores.  Data  about  the  current  or  past
favorability of different resources could be weighted in a variety of ways and combined numerically.
4 Digital Transformation Progress Model
The proposed DTPM is designed to facilitate efforts to monitor a DT initiative and make decisions that
try to maximize  its  chances  of  success.  Those  decisions should consider positive  and  negative  aspects  of
the five types of resources for change that often are relevant to the continuing progress of a DT initiative.
Throughout  the  DT  initiative,  the  relevant  information  ranges  from  largely  objective  (e.g.,  the  degree  of
completion  of  a  specific  step  in  a  project  or  the  availability  of  specific  IT  resources)  through  highly
subjective (e.g., the level of anger and resistance among stakeholders who might be affected adversely). It
could  also  include  the  level  of  threat  from  external  factors  such as  likely  changes  in  governmental
regulations or likely product announcements by competitors. In effect, a DTPM should relate a plethora of
diverse  information  to  possible  outcomes  of  the  DT  initiative  based  on  the  current  situation  at  any  point
during the initiative’s lifecycle.
The DTPM is based on the favorability of resources for change. Fig. 5 represents the DTPM as it might
be  applied  to  an  entire  DT  initiative  or  might  be  applied  separately  to  mission-critical  WSs  considered
individually. Fig. 5 represents the following verbal statement of the model:  
The favorability of  five  categories  of  resources  for  change  for  WSs  targeted  by  the  DT  initiative
contribute  individually  and  in  combination  to  the  likelihood  of  the  initiative’s  eventual  degree  of
completion  and  business  success.  The  categories  are  momentum,  capabilities, forces  affecting the
WSs,  drivers  and  impediments  related  to  WS  elements,  and  catalysts  of  change.  Each  category
includes  resources  for  change  whose  state  can be  described  at  any  time  during  a  DT  initiative  and
can  be  compared  to  an  ideal  state  relative  to  the  progress  of  the  DT  initiative.  The  state  and
favorability  of  important  resources  for  change  typically  vary over  time as  the  DT  initiative  unfolds
due to adjustment in projects within the DT initiative and ongoing changes in the targeted WSs and
in the surrounding environment.
Fig. 5. Digital Transformation Progress Model
Factors  that  contribute  to  the five  categories  of resources  for  change  are not  shown  in  Fig. 5 because
each category involves many factors mentioned earlier.
A subjective  understanding  of  how  and  why  the  DT  initiative  is  in  good  shape  or  has significant
challenges  typically  should  be  more  useful to  executive  and  managers than  a point  prediction  of  the
probability  of  success  or  a numerical  probability  distribution  for  a  given  level  of  goal  achievement.
Executives and managers who already have access to typical project management tools would not look to
the DTPM to provide the same information. A more likely use of the DTPM is as a basis for sense making
and  discussion  leading  to  further  off-line  discussion  and  executive  action  if  needed,  i.e.,  action  beyond
typical project  management  decisions  such  as  modification  of  short-term  plans  based  on  current  status,
dependencies, available resources, and the current critical path to completion.
4.1 Comparison with UTAUT  
The widely cited UTAUT (the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology) [21, 22] provides a
useful point  of  comparison  even  though  technology  acceptance  and  use differs greatly  from  DT. A
diagrammatic  representation  of  conclusions  from  a  recent  meta-analysis  of  research  related  to  UTAUT
[22, p. 39] said that use behavior is affected directly or indirectly (via behavioral intention) by:  
• seven  independent  variables  from  UTAUT2 (performance  expectancy,  effort  expectancy,  social
influence, price value, hedonic motivation, facilitating conditions, habit)
• four  extensions  (technology  compatibility,  user  education,  personal innovativeness, and  costs  of
technology
• effects  of  four types  of  moderating  variables  (individual  characteristics,  national  culture,  type  of
technology, and controls).  
Those  variables  are  related to  some  but  not  all  aspects  of  the DTPM’s five  types  of  resources for
change. Several of those variables address momentum and capabilities, the two DTPM types of resources
for  change  that  are  directly  related  to  project  management.  Since UTAUT variables operate  primarily  at
an  individual  level, they  do  not  addresses forces  that  affect  WSs  as  a  whole.  On  the  other  hand, some
UTAUT variables touch on topics that the DTPM expresses differently in its other categories.
An  additional point  for  comparison  concerns  usage.  The  extensive  meta-analysis  in [22] shows that
UTAUT is  designed  for testing the  validity  of  hypothesized  relationships  between  specific  variables  and
technology use,  a question  primarily  of  interest  to  academic  researchers. In  contrast,  the DTPM  is
designed to support  DT  initiatives that  involve  much  more  than  whether  specific  technologies  will  be
used.
5 Potential Uses of the DT Progress Model
The concepts built into the DTPM provide an organized way to visualize a DT initiative, to anticipate and
identify  issues  as  a  DT  initiative  unfolds,  and  to  evaluate  approaches  for  dealing  with  those  issues.  The
DTPM  assumes  that DT achieves  goals  by creating  or changing  mission-critical WSs  and  that  the
likelihood of success is related to the favorability of five categories of resources for change.  
The DTPM affords three potential types of use that will be discussed next. The first is as a framework
for visualizing aspects of an ongoing DT initiative.  The second is as an organizing principle for narrative
DT project reports. The third is as an organizing principle for quantitative DT project reports that combine
favorability  ratings  that  would  be  tailored  to  situation-specific  conditions  and  would  be  collected  and
combined based on user preferences.
5.1 DTPM as a Framework for Visualizing Aspects of an Ongoing DT Initiative
When viewed as a framework outlining a mental model, the DTPM encourages executives to think about
the DT as an integrated enterprise initiative that can be divided into a set of projects directed at creating or
improving  mission-critical  WSs.  The  current status  of  each  project  is  a  starting  point  for  considering
favorable  and  unfavorable  aspects  of  five  categories  of  issues  that  may  call  for  executive  decisions  and
action.
5.2 DTPM as an Organizing Principle for Narrative DT Project Reports
Table 1 shows a hypothetical example of the type of information in a DTSM-based executive summary for
an  ongoing  DT  initiative.  Table  1  assumes  that  the  DT  initiative  involves  two  mission-critical  work
systems  (WS1  and  WS2)  and  that  a  brief  summary  statement  might  mention  several  issues  for  each
category of resource favorability for each WS. Additional information would be available as backup.

Catalysts • Many long-time supervisors are quite disgruntled about the scope of change  
that  will  be required  in  their  work  practices.  Many  say  that  these  changes

5.3   DTPM as an Organizing Principle for Quantitative DT Project Reports
Table  2 illustrates  one  of  many  possible  formats  for  a numerically oriented  favorability report  showing
favorability  ratings  for  the  five  categories  of  resources  for  change. It uses sliding  scales to represent  a
continuum of possibilities from very unfavorable to very favorable for different issues. That type of report
could  help  executives  visualize  the  current  state  and  direction  of  change  for  a  DT  initiative  and  could
encourage them to inquire further about specific issues. Table 2 presents two types of information: 1) The
left  side  shows  the most  recent  three  weeks  of favorability  ratings  related  to  the  five  categories  of
resources. 2) The  right  side  shows current  favorability  ratings  for  selected  resources  for  change  within
each category.    Many  versions  of  this  type  of  report  and  other  reports  based  on  the  same  kinds of
information could be produced. For example, using the blue slider to illustrate progress across 3 weeks is
just an illustrative  example. Some  executives might prefer 2 week or 4 week histories. Nothing is sacred
about the different types of resources that are listed for each category. Executives involved in specific DT
initiatives  might  be  more  interested  in  other  types  of  resources  for  each  category and might  prefer other
formats for reporting.

6 Conclusion
The  DTSM  represents  a  new  way  to visualize  digital  transformation,  a  major  area  of practice  and
research.  Its diverse facets include  many  business  and  societal  issues that extend  beyond traditional
technology  acceptance  and  use  research topics.  The  new  approach treats DT  as  a  strategic  initiative
focusing on  IT-enabled  creation  or  improvement  of  mission-critical  WSs. The  DTSM  incorporates  many
ideas that executives and managers should consider as DT initiatives unfold and that IS researchers might
incorporate into research related to both IT adoption and DT.
The DTSM  fits  within  the  conference  theme  of  “co-creating  for  context”  because DT is  a  major  IT-
related  type  of  co-creation  involving  rich  interactions  between  local,  corporate,  and broader economic
contexts. The  DTSM’s  five  categories  of  resource  favorability  cover  that  spectrum selectively,  with
momentum  and  capabilities  focusing  on  project  issues while forces,  drivers  and  impediments,  and
catalysts of change focusing on internal and external issues related to the WSs being created or improved.
This conceptual contribution does not provide empirical verification of its intended value and is limited
to  defining,  combining,  and  illustrating  its central  ideas. Also,  the  overall  approach  was  developed  in  a
highly iterative  way  that  did  not  follow  an  established  methodology such  as  design  science  research
because  a  simple  iterative  approach  based  on  personal  knowledge  and  experience  seemed  adequate  for
proposing a unique model. A full journal paper would explain the central ideas more fully, but would still
leave a number of questions in the following areas:
Assumptions  about DT.   The literature  review  in [8] demonstrated  the  substantial  difficulty  in
defining  DT.  The  DTSM  is  based  on  definitions  of  DT  and  DT  initiative that  focus  more  on  IT-enabled
organizational  change  than  on the  idea  of  disruption  or  the  use  of  emerging  technologies. Some
researchers probably would not prefer that approach, especially if they are concerned about differentiating
DT from IT-enabled organizational change (e.g., [23]).
Completeness  of  the  DTSM. The DTSM  organizes many  ideas  that  are  relevant  to  DT,  but surely
might  be  specified  in  more  detailed  way,  perhaps  making  it  more  like  the results  of  the meta-analysis  of
UTAUT  research mentioned  earlier  [22,  p.  39].  That  level  of  detail  was  the  product of  many  research
efforts by  many  researchers.  The  DTSM  might be  specified  in  more  detail  in  the  future,  but  it  is  not
obvious  that  a  more  detailed  presentation  would  actually  be  more  useful,  as  implied  by  a  comment   by
Wittgenstein [24] cited  in  closing  a  paper [25] about  the  elusive  definition  of  information: “Is  it  even
always an advantage  to replace  an indistinct  picture  by a  sharp one? Isn't the  indistinct  one  often exactly
what we need?”
Usability of the DTSM. This paper mentioned the DTSM’s potential for organizing mental models and
for  generating  two  types  of reports  that  might  support  DT  initiatives.  Testing  those  proposed  uses  might
lead to insights about how to use the existing DTSM effectively and how to improve it.
Follow-on research. Case studies, survey research, or even careful coding of a sample of existing DT
case studies might validate the idea that the favorability of multiple resources for change can be linked to
the  success of DT initiatives. Action research and action design research might demonstrate  the  extent to
which executives can use these ideas.  Study of project management tools might find ways to add DTPM-
related  information  to  existing  approaches  for  large, consequential  projects. More direct  evidence  of the
DTSM’s value requires research projects involving researchers and organizations willing to try using the
DTSM while pursuing DT initiatives.
